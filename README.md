### This is a square.
*DOM Manipulation*, ever heard of it?

The purpose of this project was to have some fun with the DOM and CSS animations. I'd like to personally thank Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky for creating <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>. At this point the code needs some heavy refactoring. I kind of slapped things together as I went a long without too much of an end goal, but I think it turned out pretty neat.

## Tecnologies used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>

## 3 things I learned most about:
- CSS animations
- Audio with JavaScript and HTML
- <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>

*This is a disgusting heap of code, dont judge me.*

### Mobile Coming Soon!
